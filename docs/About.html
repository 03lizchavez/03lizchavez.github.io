            <h1>About</h1>
            <p> Originally from Queens, New York, I studied at two different high schools. I studied
                at, formerly known as Queens Vocational and Technical High School, now Queens
                Technical High School for a year. I majored in graphic design before transferring to
                a career and technical school, Art and Design High School, where I completed the
                remaining 3 years as a graphic design major. I received a Photoshop CS6 certificate
                at A&amp;D and interned through a CTE program where I received opportunities to
                intern for a couple of companies/industries. After graduating, I attended the City
                College of New York (CUNY) as an undergraduate student majoring in Electronic Design
                and Multimedia for 4 semesters before transferring to Penn State. I transferred to
                Penn State because I knew opportunities would broaden with PSU. After taking a
                chance to apply, I got accepted and am currently finishing the remaining time at
                Penn State Behrend pursuing DIGIT. DIGIT is short for Digital Media, Arts, and
                Technology. </p>
