2.  yes so div is the parent of cbml:panel and the descendant of cbml:panel is cbml:caption, head, bibl, and fw
3. 37 lines
5. in the branch of cbml:panel is 4 attributes, n, characters, type and place.
6. I'm not sure how to use the <floatingtext>
This is what I did but I'm almost 100% positive that it isn't correct
