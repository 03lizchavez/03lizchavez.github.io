                <p>Hello, my name is Elizabeth Chavez. I am a third-year undergraduate student at
                    Penn State Behrend majoring in DIGIT. DIGIT is short for Digital Media, Arts and
                    Technology. One of the most significant challenges for me as a new learner would
                    be remembering what elements are allowed in certain files in Oxygen. As I
                    learned as I went, I learned what elements were allowed or not allowed in each
                    document file. I learned some advantages to working on Wordpress compared to
                    XML. I like that I’d be able to create a slideshow on Wordpress to display my
                    artwork compared to XML where it’s listed instead. I do like XML though and how
                    I get to make the sit from scratch. It is a challenge as well. It’s extra steps
                    on XML. One of the challenges for XML in organizing is associating with CSS and
                    being able to design the layout to however you want it. It takes a lot of
                    playing around especially when you have no clue what you’re doing. With
                    Wordpress it was difficult to set up each new navigation page. I didn’t notice
                    it until halfway throw making “posts”. I think one of the major skills to learn
                    and develop these sites is attention to small details and also being able to get
                    out of their comfort zone. I think I should improve on getting out of my comfort
                    zone because it took me a while to accept that I needed to learn coding. I ended
                    up loving it, despite the stress that comes along with it.</p>
