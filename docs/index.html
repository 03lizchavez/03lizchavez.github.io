        <h1>Beginning HTML</h1>
        <p>Here is some sample HTML to look at. This is a body paragraph with some
                <strong>inline</strong> code to feature some text. Here is <a
                href="https://behrend.psu.edu/penn-state-behrend" style="color:DarkRed;">a link to
                an external website</a>.</p>
        <p>One of the best <strong>resources</strong> for learning HTML is <a
                href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" style="color:DarkRed;"
                >w3Schools</a>. Here is a reference for <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/"
                style="color:DarkRed;">color codes you can use for styling</a>.</p>
        <p>Each p element is a <strong>block</strong> element designed to make a block on the
            page.</p>
        <h2>What are block elements good for?</h2>
        <p>They're great for separating lines and showing that there's a new paragraph or segment
            and easier to read when it's separated.</p>
        <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. It makes a bulleted
            list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>headings</li>
            <li>paragraphs</li>
            <li>lists</li>
            <li>tables</li>
            <li>images</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Another example for the use of ul, a grocery list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>honey</li>
            <li>cilantro</li>
            <li>avocado</li>
            <li>rosemary</li>
            <li>mango</li>
            <li>blackberries</li>
            <li>And so on...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very similar
            to the <q>unordered</q> list. You have to see the difference by viewing in a web
            browser.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>morning</li>
            <li>noon</li>
            <li>afternoon</li>
            <li>evening</li>
            <li>night</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It seems to be more like a <strong>structured step-by-step order</strong> with the use of
            ol comapred to the use of ul</p>
        <ol>
            <li>get ready</li>
            <li>make breakfast</li>
            <li>take bus to school</li>
            <li>head to class</li>
            <li>finish assignments</li>
            <li>don't fail</li>
        </ol>
